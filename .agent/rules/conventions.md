# Coding Conventions

- C#: file-scoped namespaces, sealed records for messages, init-only properties, PascalCase
- JavaScript: ES modules, camelCase, Node 20+
- Python: ruff for linting/formatting, snake_case
- Conventional commit messages (feat:, fix:, docs:, refactor:, test:)
- Branch naming: feat/, fix/, bugfix/, hotfix/, setup/, pr-N
- Run pre-commit hooks before committing
